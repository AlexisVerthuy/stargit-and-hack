# LAB| GIT, CSS & HTML - Stargit and Hack

## Introduction

Welcome to Stargit and Hack !
You have learned the very basics of html, css & git throughout the prework and you can already make some pretty cool websites !
This lab is split in 2 iterations

1.  A front page.
2.  Each ironhacker builds his own page in parallel

This exercise will allow you to work in collaboration on your first project in which you and another Ironhacker will present themselves !

Collaborating with git is a little abstract at the start so don't worry if you struggle with it at the start, the earlier you get/resolve conflicts, the better.

## Submission

- Fork this repo
- Clone this repo
- Make sure you use class and id selectors throughout your exercise. Remember, only use type selectors if you want to modify every element of that type
- Once you are ready to turn the lab in:

```bash
git add
git commit -m "done"
git push
```

- Create a pull request

## Tips

- For the Iteration n°1, it's recommended to work as 1 navigator / 1 driver
- Create 2 stylesheets otherwise you'll run into git conflicts if you're both editing the same stylesheet

## Instructions

### Iteration n°1

Requirements:

- A slogan/catch phrase of your choice
- 2 images (1 of each Ironhacker side by side)
- Why you came to Ironhack

### Iteration n°2

Create 2 seperate html files (and maybe 2 different css files ?).

Requirements:

- Name / Surname
- Hobbies

After you have **_carte blanche_**.
